    qn: "Why should I use MedAtlas?",
    ans: "It is not always easy or convenient for patients to get help for their health care needs. MedAltas improves the opportunity to get healthcare closer to home, in a convenient location, and more timely way.  MedAtlas is another option for receiving care from a Specialist. The benefit is less waiting and travel time, and time away from work or other priorities. Examples include a video “chat” for mental health care, evaluation of a sick child by video, or taking a picture of a skin problem and sending it to a skin specialist for assessment.",
