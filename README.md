# MedAtlas Health System

## _The fully functional web application of medatlas health system_

# Project Details

MedAtlas Health System is project intended to enable users around Africa access medical help in the confort of their homes, my role was to implement the UI from Figma as well as integrating it with the API.
The application is built in Reactjs,TypeScript,Tailwind CSS, Redux, React Router v6, React Calender, among others

## Client's Requirements

The tasks are as follows:

1. Responsive UI and cross-browser page compatibility
2. API integration
3. Testing and Debugging
4. Documentation (Readme)

# Features

> Mobile Responsiveness:
> I had a task of making sure that the web pages are made responsive on different device widths

> Semantic tags:
> Use of the know semantic tags was also a checkpoint during the project, making sure that we used only tags that were neccessary.

> Beautiful UI and UX âœ¨:
> Bringing out the webpages as they appear in the mockup was the major goal of this task.

> Adding Logic and Making API Calls:
> After the UI implementation, i had to add logic to the UIs making different calls and storing data in redux and passing it on to the different components where it had to be displayed. It was such an awesome experience getting to learn how to connect to metamask extension and capturing the account address to use it when making calls for different transactions.
